Clean up Windows by simply replacing crucial parts of it with inferior solutions!
Lightvision replaces things with Rainmeter and AutoHotKey instead.

Lightvision's OSD uses the same code as [UnPlayer](https://github.com/sctanf/unplayer) and supports all players from NowPlaying's supported list, WebNowPlaying, Spotify, and Google Play Music Desktop Player.

### If you are using a browser:
For browser support, (Youtube, Web Spotify, SoundCloud, etc.) you need to download the companion extension in your browser.
For Chrome, go [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webnowplaying-companion/jfakgfcdgpghbbefmdfjkbdlibjgnbli), and for Firefox, go [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/webnowplaying-companion). Other browsers, if they support Chrome/Firefox extensions, should work too.

To use the browser extension in Firefox, you'll need to go to the **about:config** page and set **network.websocket.allowInsecureFromHTTPS** to true.

### If you are using Spotify:
If you want to use Spotify, you need to use khanhas's [Spicetify](https://github.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli/wiki/Guide-for-Rainmeter-user).
